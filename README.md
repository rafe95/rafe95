# Hello visitor!
### Welcome to my profile
I'm a software engineer who loves JVM technologies, Linux and problem solving.
I've been on software development for 5+ years.
I like challenges and learning new things. I'm constantly reading and looking for 
new stuff related to good coding practices, design patterns, software architecture, 
team management, UI/UX and TDD.
